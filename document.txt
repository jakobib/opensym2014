# Collaborative writing a Wikidata handbook with Pandoc & git

...abstract...

## Collaborative Writing

* Collaborative writing has become more and more widespread, not only in dedicated wikis, such as Wikipedia, but as common practice at work and among scholars.

* Several collaborative writing tools exist
  * Google Docs / Drive
  * MediaWiki
  * Confluence
  * Etherpad
  * Penflip
  * Fidus Writer
  * Draft
  * Editorially
  * DHWriter
  * ZOHO Docs
  * ...in addition: revision control systems (git), Dropbox, Bittorrent Sync...
* Book sprints

## Wikidata

...poorly documented (a lot of description, but very confusing, especially for non-English documentation)...

## The Project

...three month, nine students, no previous knowledge in any of the specific skills (Wikidata and collaborative writing in general, Markdown and git in particular)...

## Tools

* Penflip
* Pandoc Markdown
* Trello (project management)
* Technical workflow: Penflip -> git -> pandoc -> HTML/PDF
* Writing Workflow: several hours meetings once a week

## Result & lessons learned

Writing:
* ...Penflip is still very new
* ...complexity of git hidden well, but merging still difficult
* ...missing live editing as supported in Etherpad
* ...integration of Pandoc missing, must be added by hand
* ...missing easy functionality to move around / rearange texts
