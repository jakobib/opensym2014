# Introduction

In the two years of its existence Wikidata^[<https://www.wikidata.org>] has become a central part of the Wikimedia projects [@Vrandecic2014]. In a nutshell, Wikidata is a multi-lingual database, but it's not easy to grasp what this actually means. The internal documentation of Wikidata is complex and incomplete in many parts, especially in other languages but English. This article describes the collaborative creation of a German documentation Wikidata with focus on authority control in Wikidata. The experience report will first introduce Wikidata and collaborative writing in general, followed by the more specific topic of the resulting handbook. It will then describe organization and tools of creation and conclude with results and lessons learned.

## Wikidata

Wikidata is an open knowledge base operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. It was started in 2012 to support the other Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia, Wikisource, and Wikibooks^[<https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Our_projects>] with a central, multilingual database. Contributions to the database are likewise possible by anyone in virtually any language. As of spring 2014, parts of Wikidata functionality are still being implemented. By then Wikidata includes names, numbers, connections and other structured data about more than 15 million objects. Despite its growing importance, Wikidata is not widely known, expect among Open Data enthusiasts. Its documentation, given in form of help pages, can be quite confusing, especially when not read in English. This shortage is apperent for several reasons: first, the documentation is created by a volunteers without deadlines trying to describe a moving target in multiple languages in parallel. Second, structured data -- the subject matter of Wikidata -- is no familiar concept to most people. Quite the contrary, multiple notions of data are often confused [@BallsunStanton2012;@Voss2013] so it's not obvious what kind of database Wikidata actually is. 

From a library and information science point of view, at least parts of Wikidata resemble an authority file: Wikidata records about objects, entities, or concepts are called *items*. Each item can have at most one preferred *label* per language and multiple alternative labels (*aliases*). Items can further have scope notes (*descriptions*) and *statements*. The latter are what makes Wikidata a knowledge base: a statement is kind of an enriched key-value pair with controlled fields as *properties*. Statement can either assign values to items (e.g. a literals, numbers, coordinates...) or connect items with each other. Statements can further be contextualized with qualifiers, ranks, and references.

## Collaborative Writing

The principle of collaborative writing has been familiar to Wikipedia authors and open source developers since more than a decade. The first wave of online writing tools, during the rise of Web 2.0, focused on wikis with Wikipedia as most popular example. Meanwhile wiki functionalities have become almost ubiquitous and more specialized applications have evolved. This development is driven by progress in web application technologies and by the establishment of the internet as ubiquuus medium. Cloud services facilitate access to documents from any location and revision control systems such as git^[http://git-scm.com/book/] become known and used also outside of software development. These two features, easy access and tracking changes, support the creation of any collaborative writing tool. Several of these tools exist or are being developed (Google Docs/Drive, Etherpad, Penflip, Typewrite, and Fidus Writer to name some). A recent overview has been given by [@Schreiber2014] and by [@Schoch2014] but the current state of collaborative writing tools is very dynamic.

By now the dynamic creation of knowledge artifacts by collaborative writing is becoming more and more common also among scholars [@Heller2014]. An example of new practices and processes that evolve around collaborative writing is the *book sprint*. A book sprint is an event that brings together a group of experts to create a book in a few days. The book is made available immediately at the end of the sprint as ebook and/or print-on-demand.

<!-- Examples of successfull booksprints include ...
 Open Journalism handbook etc. -->

# Topic of the handbook

The Bachelor's degree in information management at Hannover University of Applied Sciences and Art includes a project to be conducted during one semester in supervised groups of eight to ten students. In spring 2014 the following task was offered:

* creation of a handbook on Wikidata
* written comprehensible in German
* focus on authority control in Wikidata
* publishing as ebook in HTML, PDF, and printed

The general goal of the project is to learn and practice basic concepts of project management. The particular task required to familiarize with a new and exciting topic (Wikidata) and to get into the whole process of creating a book, including media-neutral publishing. The focus on authority control in Wikidata was chosen to highlight an aspect of Wikidata that is also relevant to information management. As mentioned above, parts of Wikidata also resemble an authority file such as classifications, taxonomies and other controlled vocabularies used in cataloging and indexing. A deeper look reveals that many statements in Wikidata refer to other authority files as well. To give an example, the Wikidata property `P1036`^[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1036] is used to state the notation of Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) that corresponds to a Wikidata item. 

..can be used to find related literature...

... authority properties in Wikidata have string values that, if used as IDs, link into another authority file...Wikidata statements with identifiers as values...
... authority files can be connected/mapped. The largest project to such a mapping is VIAF
see SeAlso/BEACON [@Voss2011]...
Wikidata is both, an authority file in its own right, and hub for (inter)linking authority files.

Mappings between authority files are important for interoperability but rarely 
Wikipedia community has already proven to create mappings with GND to Wikipedia...

# Organization and tools

Nine students were assigned to the project to create a German Wikidata handbook with focus on authority control. Beginning from March we met once a week for 5 hours the following 14 weeks (with a break on easter holidays).^[The project still going on at the time of writing this article.] Given the fact that none of the students hat prior knowledge of Wikidata or serious collaborative writing in general, this time is comparable with a typical book sprint lasting 4 to 5 full days. Depending on the particular task the group was divided into smaller teams work or the book was created self-organized during the meetings.

The technical workflow was set up and later extended by the supervisor to ensure a build process.

The project started with a brief introduction to project management, Wikidata and the aspired topic of the handbook. We then collected first ideas for an outline and tools for the project. In the end, the following tool were used:

* Trello^[<https://trello.com>] for project management
* Penflip^[<https://penflip.com>] for collaborative writing
* Pandoc^[<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>] to build the book in several output formats (PDF, HTML, ePUB...)
* GitHub^[<https://github.com>] as alternative provider of the book repository and for hosting snapshots
* Annotator^[<https://annotatorjs.org>] for distributed proofreading  

## Pandoc

Pandoc is an open source software to convert between different types of markup formats (HTML, LaTeX, DocBook, MediaWiki...). It's primary markup format is Markdown, a simple text-based format introduced by ... (see image/example...).

Pandoc adds several syntax extensions to Markdown, such as tables, footnotes, and references. All input formats are converted to the internal document model of Pandoc for output in HTML, PDF, and EPUB among other formats.

It has been proposed to extend the Pandoc document model [@Krijnen2014], but one of its strength is the limitation to a fixed set of possible document elements. This "less is more" principle of features also applies to Penflip, as explicitly stated by its author [@Burton2014].

# Result

collaboratively written in German . The resulting handbook is being made available in multiple formats under a free license (CC-BY-SA). We hope that others can not only benefit from the result but only from the process and lessons learned.

Large parts of the book, however, give a introduction into Wikidata in general. ... can be reused for introductions to Wikidata for other purpose as well.

It can then be embedded into Wikipedia articles and reused in other context as well. 

book, written by the participants, organized as following:
* outline ToC
X pages in A5 format

snapshots can be accessed at GitHub ...

PDF and printed will be made available as PDF and print on demand.

# Findings and lessons learned

...we learned about wikidata and project management...
...Tried to do Agile development. Worked to some degree (the term is ...), not fully applicapable, but at least: always ensure a build process (at least for HTML and PDF)...

## Wikidata

When getting in touch with **Wikidata** we found most parts of the user interface are not very complicated. Nevertheless it was difficult to find all relevant aspects of Wikidata for several reasons. First, the abstract nature of Wikidata as database is less obvious to understand than an encyclopedia (Wikipedia), a media collection (Wikimedia Commons), or a travel guide (Wikivoyage), to name a few alternative Wikimedia projects. Second, the Wikidata project is still evolving so it was not always clear which features are planned, which are implemented, and which are actually used in practice. The third and maybe the most important barrier of adoption is the general state of documentation within and about the project. The problem is not a lack of documentation but its organization and fragmentation across different wikis, pages, and languages. Information about implementation and planning is mixed with descriptions and usage guidelines in different levels of detail and relevance. Especially pages in different languages seem to be not in sync with the ongoing development of Wikidata and with each other, so one cannot avoid also consulting the English documentation. We hope to improve this situation by providing a consistent introductionary documentation, at least for German.

## Penflip

Writing with Penflip:

* ...Penflip is still very new, some usability issues
* ...complexity of git hidden well, but merging still difficult
* ...missing live editing as supported in Etherpad
* ...integration of Pandoc missing, must be added by hand
* ...missing easy functionality to move around / rearange texts

## Git

...mostly hidden to the participants... Merge and branches are not suitable

## Annotator

easy method of annotation but not stable at the time of writing. Does not work for changing documents...

## Conducting a book sprint at university course

the term "book sprint" does not fully match because...
nevertheless...

Booksprint-alike, conducted with students.

...Book sprint..
...better: team of people familiar and newbiews for not to ¨Betriebsblind¨ neither long phase of intro

nine students, none of them with prior knowledge of Wikidata or collaborative writing in general or Markdown and git in particular.
