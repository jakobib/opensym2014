[OpenSym 2014](http://opensym.org/os2014/) (formerly WikiSym) will be held in Berlin on August 27-29. Call for paper deadline is April 20th. This article is going to be submitted to the [Community Track](http://www.opensym.org/os2014/submission/community-track-call/). Short experience reports may be 2-4 pages long, long experience reports may be 5-10 pages long.

## Goal of the project

* Simple Handbook, easy introduction
* in German
* focus on authority files in Wikidata
* printed PDF, E-Book, and HTML

## Collaborative Writing

* Collaborative writing has become more and more widespread, not only in dedicated wikis, such as Wikipedia, but as common practice at work and among scholars.

* Several collaborative writing tools exist
  * Google Docs / Drive
  * MediaWiki
  * Confluence
  * Etherpad
  * Penflip
  * Fidus Writer
  * Draft
  * Editorially
  * DHWriter
  * ZOHO Docs
  * ...in addition: revision control systems (git), Dropbox, Bittorrent Sync...
* Book sprints

## Wikidata

...poorly documented (a lot of description, but very confusing, especially for non-English documentation)...

## The Project

...three month, nine students, no previous knowledge in any of the specific skills (Wikidata and collaborative writing in general, Markdown and git in particular)...

## Tools

* Penflip
* Pandoc Markdown
* Trello (project management)
* Technical workflow: Penflip -> git -> pandoc -> HTML/PDF
* Writing Workflow: several hours meetings once a week

## Result & lessons learned

Writing:
* ...Penflip is still very new
* ...complexity of git hidden well, but merging still difficult
* ...missing live editing as supported in Etherpad
* ...integration of Pandoc missing, must be added by hand
* ...missing easy functionality to move around / rearange texts

**Pandoc** is an open source software to convert between different types of markup formats (HTML, LaTeX, DocBook, MediaWiki...).
It's primary markup format is Markdown, a simple text-based format introduced by ... (see image/example...).

Pandoc adds several syntax extensions to Markdown, such as tables, footnotes, and references. All input formats are converted to the internal document model of Pandoc for output in HTML, PDF, and EPUB among other formats.

It has been proposed to extend the Pandoc document model [@Krijnen2014], but one of its strength is the limitation to a fixed set of possible document elements. This "less is more" principle of features also applies to Penflip, as explicitly stated by its author [@Burton2014].
