This git repository contains source code of paper and slides of *Collaborative
creation of a Wikidata handbook* by Jakob Vo√ü (2014). The publication has been
submitted, accepted and presented at [OpenSym 2014](http://opensym.org/os2014/)
(formerly WikiSym) Community Track in Berlin.

A PDF copy of the paper has been deposited with DOI
[10.5281/zenodo.11249](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11249).

The paper is not included in the official proceedings just because the
publisher ACM requires a ridiculous Open Access fee or exclusive rights.

**Abstract**: This article describes the theoretical and practical background
of a collaborative writing project resulting in a handbook on Wikidata and
authority control. The handbook was created by an untrained group of students
during three month in spring 2014. It was written in Pandoc Markdown in a git
repository at Penflip.com.
