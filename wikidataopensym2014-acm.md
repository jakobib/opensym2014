abstract: This article describes the theoretical and practical background of a collaborative writing project resulting in a handbook on Wikidata and authority control. The handbook was created by an untrained group of students during three month in spring 2014. It was written in Pandoc Markdown in a git repository at Penflip.com.

# Introduction

The paper "Collaborative creation of a Wikidata handbook" was accepted for a
short experience report at the OpenSym '14 conference community
track.^[<http://www.opensym.org/os2014/submission/community-track-call/>] For
inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors are required to assign
exclusive publishing rights to the publisher ACM. Never in my life have I fully
given away rights on my publication instead of just releasing everything as
Open Access. For this reason this text the full text of the paper has been made
available as public domain at <https://zenodo.org/record/11249> with DOI
[10.5281/zenodo.11249](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11249). 

# Summary

Despite its name and topic, OpenSym conference does not commit to the goals of
Open Access and Open Content movement by publishing the conference proceedings
at ACM. The height of Open Access fees such as demanded by ACM and similar
publishers is ridculous given that all work is done by authors and conference
organizers for free. If all authors would just publish their works in open
repositories, they could better be judged by theit content instead of the name
of a publisher.
